# 📘 C# Fundamentals 

---

## 👋 Overview

This repository contains **beginner-friendly C# console programs** completed as part of the **Day 0 C# Fundamentals challenges**.
The goal of these challenges is to build a strong foundation in:

* Console input and output
* Variables and data types
* Arithmetic operations
* Conditionals
* Loops
* Basic algorithms

Each challenge is implemented as a **separate `.cs` file** and compiled using the **C# compiler (`csc`)**.
